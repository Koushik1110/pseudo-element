        In our previous classes we did some work on lists. From those classes we learn how to create ul-unordered list and ol- ordered list.Now in this segment of the class we will learn how to color or edit the items on those list. For example as the winter is right around the corner we can create a list of winter vegetables and edit them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Potato</li>
            <li>Eggplant</li>
            <li>Cauliflower</li>
            <li>Beans</li>
            <li>Cabbage</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="hover-description">
        Using the pseudo element we colored the first and last vegetables with the color code.If we want to color the rest of those thins we will also be able to do that. </p>
