    <h1 class="pseudo-element">Pseudo element</h1>
    <p class="hover-description" >
        Web developing is a work of art. all the small things in the web developing contributes to the structure of a website.A web developer needs to use his sense to add, remove, restructure, ease of use and a lot of things to make a website.So every single things we learn in CSS, no matter how big or small it is ha a big contribution in the website. One of those element is called"<span class="hover-text">pseudo element</span>".
    </p>
    <h2 class="hover-heading">Hover</h2>
    <p class="hover-description">The first topic of this lecture is called "<span class="hover-text">pseudo element</span>".There are a lot of pseudo elements in css. but the first thing we will learn about is hover.Hover is a function that allows the text to change its form factor when mouse cursor is placed on the things that is customized with hover function.We can also do a lot of other things such as change the font size, add new color and a lot other things.</p>

    <h2 class="hover-heading" >
        The list coloring
    </h2>

    <p class="hover-description">
        In our previous classes we did some work on lists. From those classes we learn how to create ul-unordered list and ol- ordered list.Now in this segment of the class we will learn how to color or edit the items on those list. For example as the winter is right around the corner we can create a list of winter vegetables and edit them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Potato</li>
            <li>Eggplant</li>
            <li>Cauliflower</li>
            <li>Beans</li>
            <li>Cabbage</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="hover-description">
        Using the pseudo element we colored the first and last vegetables with the color code.If we want to color the rest of those thins we will also be able to do that. In order to do that we need to set the whole list with a nth child. In any case we must remember that css prioritize the last command the most.If we forget that it may cause some unnecessary complications.</p>

    <h2 class="hover-heading">
        Position
    </h2>
    <p class="hover-description">
        Position is one of the most important topic in CSS. using this we can resize, overlap and combine images.We can do a lot of meaningful things using this function.
    </p>
        <div class="container">
            <img class="image boy" src="./swim/boy.svg" alt="">
            <img class="image ring" src="./swim/ring.svg" alt="">
            <img class="image water" src="./swim/water.svg" alt="">
        </div>
        <p class="hover-description">
            In the previous three picture we can see that we have combined and overlap them to create a meaningful picture. We did it using the positioning and a function called z-index. All of us should remember math graphs in the earlier days of our school life.There are two axis and four quadrant in a graph chart.The value of x and y axis determine the position of a point in a graph chart. In css we use z index in the similar way.The value we put on the left, right, top and bottom determines the position of the pictures.
        </p>

        <h2 class="hover-heading">
            Overflow
        </h2>
        <p class="hover-description">
            Overflow is one of the most important function in web development.In a lot of cases we do not want the description of an element to take up the space of most of our website display, because most of the time we do not want to see all the description to ruin the browsing experience of a website. On the other hand having the necessary explanation is a must for a website. In order to resolve the conflict we use overflow. Overflow is a option that shows the first few lines of the paragraph but if you want to read or want to access the whole thing all we need to do is to do is to click or hover the cursor on the box.For example:
        </p>
        <div class="overflow">
            
                <h2 class="overflow_heading">Newspapers: Benefits and Drawbacks</h2>
        
<p>
    Newspapers are one of the oldest and most widely used forms of mass media. They provide information, entertainment, education, and opinion to the public. Newspapers have many benefits and drawbacks, depending on how they are used and consumed.
</p>

<p>
    One of the main benefits of newspapers is that they offer a variety of news and perspectives from different sources and regions. Newspapers can cover local, national, and international events, as well as sports, business, culture, and lifestyle. Newspapers can also provide in-depth analysis, commentary, and criticism on various topics and issues. Newspapers can help people stay informed, aware, and engaged with the world around them.
</p>

<p>
    Another benefit of newspapers is that they can foster a sense of community and democracy. Newspapers can serve as a platform for public debate, dialogue, and participation. Newspapers can also promote social justice, human rights, and civic responsibility by exposing corruption, injustice, and abuse of power. Newspapers can also celebrate diversity, culture, and heritage by highlighting the achievements and contributions of different groups and individuals.
</p>

<p>
    However, newspapers also have some drawbacks that need to be considered. One of the main drawbacks of newspapers is that they can be biased, inaccurate, or misleading. Newspapers can reflect the interests, agendas, and ideologies of their owners, editors, or advertisers. Newspapers can also omit, distort, or sensationalize facts to attract readers or influence opinions. Newspapers can also be influenced by external pressures, such as political censorship, legal threats, or economic constraints.
</p>

<p>
    Another drawback of newspapers is that they can be outdated, irrelevant, or redundant. Newspapers can lag behind other forms of media, such as television, radio, or internet, in terms of speed, accessibility, and interactivity. Newspapers can also lose their relevance or significance as new information or developments emerge. Newspapers can also repeat or recycle information that is already available or known to the public.
</p>

<p>
    In conclusion, newspapers are a valuable source of information and communication that have both advantages and disadvantages. Newspapers can provide a wide range of news and views that can inform, entertain, educate, and inspire people. However, newspapers can also be biased, inaccurate, or misleading that can misinform, confuse, manipulate, or offend people. Therefore, it is important for readers to be critical and selective when reading newspapers.
